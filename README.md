* Progress Tracking: The ability to save and display results over time to track progress.

As a creator I want:

* Present the content in a understandable manner
* Site is easily understandable
* Clear indication about time left to complete the quote

<!-- TOC --><a name="responsiveness"></a>

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

Steps to test:

1. Open the browser and navigate to [A simple typing test](https://gkopanidis.github.io/ci-pp2-typing-test/)
2. Open the developer tools (right-click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to a maximum width

Expected:

The Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.


<!-- TOC --><a name="accessibility"></a>

### Accessibility
[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout the development and for the final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions were read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

### Unfixed Bugs

- No bugs found at this time

<!-- TOC --><a name="deployment"></a>

## Deployment


<!-- TOC --><a name="version-control"></a>

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to Git Hub to the remote repository ‘ci-pp2-typing-test’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on Git Hub.


<!-- TOC --><a name="deployment-github"></a>

### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
   - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
   - From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch
   - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

<!-- TOC --><a name="clone-repo-locally"></a>

### Clone the Repository Code Locally

Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone to use locally:

- Click on the code drop-down button
- Click on HTTPS
- Copy the repository link to the clipboard
- Open your IDE of choice (git must be installed for the next steps)
- Type git clone copied-git-URL into the IDE terminal

The project will now be cloned on your local machine for use.
